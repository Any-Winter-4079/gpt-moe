#                     Muon                     #
################################################
# In Muon, the goal is:
#   For 2D weight matrices (e.g., Linear weights of shape (out_features, in_features)),
#   build an SGD+momentum update g, then REPLACE it with its nearest orthogonal
#   matrix (orthogonalization), and apply that as the step. This helps keep layers
#   well-conditioned and discourages rank collapse.
# ---------
# Muon vs AdamW:
#   Muon uses SGD + momentum to form g, then orthogonalizes g (via the backend) and scales it.
#   Use Muon for 2D block weights (e.g., transformer.h.*.weight).
#   Keep embeddings, layer norms, biases, and the final lm_head on AdamW.
#   Train these disjoint  param sets with their respective optimizers in parallel.
#   To use it with 4D convolutional filters, flatten the last 3 dimensions.
# ---------
# The backend is simply the algorithm used to orthogonalize the 2D update matrix. Three choices are:
#   svd:
#       Exact, via SVD. If G = U S V^T, the projection of G (in Frobenius norm) onto the Stiefel
#       manifold (the set of all orthonormal k-frames, with a k-frame an ordered set of 
#       k linearly independent vectors in an n-dimensional vector space) is U V^T 
#       (i.e., the closest matrix with orthonormal columns/rows).
#   newtonschulz5:
#       Fast, iterative approximation (GPU-friendly) using a quintic Newton-Schulz iteration.
#       It avoids an SVD on every step, runs well in bfloat16, and plays nice with torch.compile.
#   polarexpress:
#       Polar Express sign method (fast iterative), fixed 5-step coefficients.
# ---------
# It is recommended to use Nesterov-style momentum in the internal SGD.
# ---------
# # QKV note:
#   If a fused projection has shape (3d, d), we split it into three (d, d) blocks and
#   orthogonalize each block separately. After orthogonalization we scale updates by
#   sqrt(max(m, n)) so update magnitudes are well-behaved.
# ---------
# Why @torch.compile on newtonschulz5?
#   The kernel is a small loop of matmuls; compiling fuses ops and reduces Python overhead,
#   generating an efficient GPU kernel.
#   SVD is a single library call and doesn’t benefit.

    Muon: MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz

    Muon internally runs standard SGD-momentum, and then performs an orthogonalization post-
    processing step, in which each 2D parameter's update is replaced with the nearest orthogonal
    matrix. To efficiently orthogonalize each update, we use a Newton-Schulz iteration, which has
    the advantage that it can be stably run in bfloat16 on the GPU.

    Some warnings:
    - This optimizer assumes that all parameters passed in are 2D.
    - It should not be used for the embedding layer, the final fully connected layer, or any {0,1}-D
    parameters; those should all be optimized by a standard method (e.g., AdamW).
    - To use it with 4D convolutional filters, it works well to just flatten their last 3 dimensions.
    - We believe it is unlikely to work well for training with small batch size.
    - We believe it may not work well for finetuning pretrained models, but we haven't tested this.
    - We have not yet tried this optimizer for training scenarios larger than NanoGPT (124M).

    Arguments:
        lr: The learning rate used by the internal SGD.
        momentum: The momentum used by the internal SGD.
        nesterov: Whether to use Nesterov-style momentum in the internal SGD. (recommended)
        backend: The chosen backend for the orthogonalization step. (recommended: 'newtonschulz5')
        backend_steps: The number of iteration steps to use in the backend, if it is iterative.
